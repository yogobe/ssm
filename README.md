# AWS SSM for yogobe
A repository for storing scripts we use for AWS SSM. Due to bugs and time constraints we need this repository to be public, however, it also contains shell scripts someone might find useful for quieting SideKiq workers in a Docker container.

This is inspired from the project Snow White - but with modifications due to us having to run the scripts on some docker containers.
